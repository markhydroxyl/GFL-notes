TL notes:
- the original author and the simulator use phone numpad convention for tile formations; this translation uses keyboard numpad convention for tile formations.

# Overview
Rating: General Use - **A+**

How to use: FP AR, skill useful for taking out enemy position

Stronger at long battles, but performance is not outstanding; slightly better than Homete

Recommendation level: satisfactory, can be raised

# Details
**Blazar** - passive: when attacking enemies ahead of self, increases FP by 20%. Skill peculiarities:

- passive proc area is the same lane
- proc area has special markers, but excluding the active, doesn't affect her targetting

**Blazar** - active: increases FP by 65% for 5s, prioritizing the closest enemy ahead.

Under ideal conditions (i.e. during active against enemies in the same lane), peak DPS self-buff is 98%, average FP self-buff is 61.25% as the battle duration approaches infinity.

# DPS Performance
**Typical battle conditions** (15 eva, 20s): because the active uptime is 5s with an 8s cooldown, performance in short to medium length battles is inferior to a more conventional Damage Focus T skill (10s uptime, 16s cooldown). In the echelon below, AK-Alfa's performance is **1.18/1.11** Hometes, with and without passive proc, respectively. In fact, if there happens to be no enemies in the same lane during the active proc, performance *may be even worse*.

The echelon: Homete on position 7, Grizzly on position 4, AK-Alfa on position 1, UMP45 Mod on position 5, P22 on position 2. Fairy is 5\* parachute with Damage 2.

**Long battles** (30-50s duration, 30 eva): generally, long battles are boss battles. Assuming that the boss doesn't move much and is in the correct lane, AK-Alfa can reach **1.27** Hometes (using the same echelon as before).

However, this data isn't actually that great. If you have to blame something, blame the fact that we have too many good ARs and that AK-Alfa came at the wrong time.

ST AR-15 with M4A1's Seal of the Avenger reaches 2.08 Hometes; Howa Type 89 reaches 1.77 Hometes; Deagle (without giving teammates any buffs) reaches 1.61 Hometes; AK-12 reaches 1.32 Hometes; AN94 (no passive proc) reaches 1.30 Hometes; G11 (with Ribeyrolles) reaches 1.29 Hometes.](https://i0.hdslb.com/bfs/article/5cb58685809c2607afe13672bdf2ae7c97d97e11.png@1320w_620h.webp "A weird woman has been mixed in")

Oh right, ~~to add another nail in the coffin~~ by the way, AK-Alfa will likely never have advantaged bonus.

# Peculiarity 1: Tiles
AK-Alfa's tiles affect both ARs and SMGs, but the tile shape doesn't hit any dolls in the same column. At the present time, the only doll that really appreciates these tiles is M16A1. Hopefully, in the future, we may get more ARs with multiple viable positions, or battles that require strange formation shapes. Perhaps AK-Alfa can shine brighter at that time.

# Peculiarity 2: Synergy with SAF? Not really
At first glance, it appears as though AK-Alfa can be paired with SAF to take advantage of AK-Alfa's passive and SAF manipulating enemy positioning. However, considering that even when attacking enemies on the same lane, AK-Alfa doesn't do great, and the fact that SAF doesn't have synergy with the AR team, it is unnecessary to shove SAF into an echelon just to make AK-Alfa perform better.

For now, it's better to use SAF's enemy positioning manipulation to help Kord or Hanyang MOD's pierce skills.

# Team Composition Recommendations
Just slap her in any regular ARSMG, G41 is perfectly fine as a partner.

# Ranking and Similar Dolls

The tags at the top are "DPS", "FP oriented", "priority backline", and "FP buffer". R5 can be considered an inferior AK-Alfa, while AK-12 has a similar ranking as AK-Alfa.

# Summary
Performance dependent on enemy positioning, better suited to long battles.

Insufficient specialization, decent for general use.

Satisfactory, can be raised, especially as a waifu.
