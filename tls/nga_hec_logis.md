# Preface

In my previous post [Mengxin Raising and Long-term Raising Planning Strategies](https://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=24080978), the planning for resources was mentioned, but the acquisition of resources (i.e. the logistics schedule) was not detailed. In fact, I've been working on it this entire time, but I haven't had much free time. However, I rushed through my work during the Christmas break, and I put the logistics schedules I found rather reliable below for everyone to see. Feedback is greatly appreciated. The aim of this post is to collect everyone's logistics schedules (**sources will be indicated**).

Unlike other posts about logistics schedules, this post is meant for 24 hour logistics schedules, for true handholding.

**Here are the assumptions for all logistics schedules**:
- **9 hours of sleep**. Studies show that 6-9 hours of sleep is imperative for healthy functioning; any behaviour like staying up until 3 a.m. or waking up at 5 a.m. to send/collect logis is not playing the game, it's called being played by the game.
- **No changing logistics mid-day**. To facilitate minimal disruption of daily activities, you only need to resend logis.
- **Total cycle duration is shorter than 24 hours**. There is a bit of buffer time included for each logi cycle for cases where you forget to collect logis.

In the figures below, for convenience, the figures assume that the commander **wakes up at 9 a.m.** and **goes to sleep at midnight**, so all night logistics are sent out before midnight, and the 4 daytime logistics are sent out after waking up while brushing their teeth. Of course, most commanders do not sleep for this long ~~heartbreak~~, so please adjust the schedules to your own situation.

Finally, many thanks to [@chtxx](https://bbs.nga.cn/nuke.php?func=ucp&__inchst=UTF-8&username=chtxx) dalao's [Logistics Combination Calculator](https://chantx.net/gf/) for the myriad contributions to my own logistics planning and to the preparation and calculation of the logistics schedules below.

## TL: How to read the schedules
Since everything in the schedule figures are in Chinese and I'm too lazy to remake them in English, here's how to read each figure.

At the top is the title, which is identical to the section header.

For the upper chart, each row represents one of the four echelons, and the vertical lines are there to visually distinguish when the logi needs to be collected (diagonal lines indicate at the half hour mark). The row of numbers is simply the time of day in 24 hour format.

For the lower table, the columns from left to right are: MP, ammo, MRE, parts, equipment tickets (blue), T-Doll tickets (white), quick production tickets (orange). The rows from top to bottom are: expected income from daytime + evening logistics, expected income from overnight logistics, daily quest rewards (I think one quick production ticket is missing), daily passive income, daily grand total.

The assumed logistic great success rate is 60% (i.e. average logistics doll level is 100 across every echelon).

# 1. Normal 500x4 Fairy Crafting Schedules

This is the schedule that I've used for the longest. This schedule guarantees enough resources for 16 HECs per day, with enough surplus for completing daily missions, exploration, clearing maps, weekly missions, and possibly even free up a bit of resources for crafting SGs. It is recommended for commanders currently in the 500x4 or Parachute preparation phase to use this schedule.

Thanks to [@流水席](https://bbs.nga.cn/nuke.php?func=ucp&__inchst=UTF-8&username=%E6%B5%81%E6%B0%B4%E5%B8%AD) for this schedule. Compared to the first 500x4 schedule, a few equipment tickets are traded for more resources. When attempting 16 fairy crafts per day, the total equipment ticket consumption per day is 20, so when including the weekly missions, this schedule should just be able to break even on equipment tickets.

# 2. Extreme 500x4 Fairy Crafting Schedule

This schedule has the exact same daytime logistics as the **first 500x4 schedule**; the difference comes from the evening and night logistics. If you slack too much, the 500x4 logistics schedules will push the resources past your softcap. At this time, you can switch to the extreme schedule to increase the parts income and craft more fairies per day. Note that, with 16 500x4 HECs per day, this schedule is net negative for MP, ammo, and MRE unless you skip exploration, and this schedule is meant to burn excess non-parts resources. This schedule is not meant for regular use.

# 3. Mixed Threshold Fairy Crafting Schedule

![](https://img.nga.178.com/attachments/mon_202012/24/-bqqbQ5-i5xlK29T3cSrq-db.jpg)

This schedule is used for 6-7 daily threshold fairy crafts, mixed between the Parachute recipe (2000/500/2000/1000) and Combo recipe (500/2000/2000/1000). This schedule is slightly short on parts, so you can use the extreme schedule for two days, and the parts excess will last you quite a long time.

# 4. Parachute Fairy Crafting Schedule

![](https://img.nga.178.com/attachments/mon_202012/24/-bqqbQ5-8aizK28T3cSsp-df.jpg)

![](https://img.nga.178.com/attachments/mon_202012/24/-bqqbQ5-8i2yK2bT3cSrl-d6.jpg)

For Parachute crafts, we have two different logistics schedules. The first one is for the sane, while the second one is for the insane. The second schedule's actual resource income is slightly lower in practice, since you cannot consistently collect 9-1 every half hour. Using the insane schedule, 7 Parachute crafts per day can be maintained; with the sane schedule, only 6 can be done per day, and lots of excess ammo will be generated.

# 5. Lazy 500x4 Fairy Crafting Schedule

![](https://img.nga.178.com/attachments/mon_202012/25/-bqqbQ5-a5oxK2bT3cSrs-dd.jpg)

Thanks to [@恒干](https://bbs.nga.cn/nuke.php?func=ucp&__inchst=UTF-8&username=%E6%81%92%E5%B9%B2) for this schedule. This schedule only requires you to collect logistics three times during the day, while making up for the loss of equipment tickets in the evening. The main disadvantage of this schedule is the relatively small equipment ticket count, supporting only 11-12 fairy crafts per day. Recommended for those who cannot or do not want to collect logistics frequently during the day.

# Postscript

Okay, I'll stop my phishing here, let's just slowly finish the post; the goal of this post was to collect everyone's suggestions, anyways.
