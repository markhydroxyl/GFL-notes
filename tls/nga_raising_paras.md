# Preface
I was originally just writing this casually, what preface.

This document can be considered as an extra to the [Long-term planning strategies] series. With reasonable planning, raising any one 5\* para from **0 dev exp** should take about **70-100 days**. Surprised? Shocked? You've been playing for years, and yet you still don't have a single 5\* para? So, how do we scientifically raise 5\* paras? Let's dive right in.

# Part 1: Costs
5\* parachute fairies are essentially a bundle of a *massive* amount of the 4 resources, a significant number of calibration tickets, plus a bit of training data.

To raise a combat-ready para, you need:

1. one para fairy
2. 3000 dev exp's worth of fodder
3. resources for enhancement
4. resources for calibration
5. exp for raising the para to Lv100
6. data for bringing the para to SL10

### Para Fairy
According to \[IOP出货统计\] (IOP Statistics, a website that tracks CN's pull rates: http://gfdb.baka.pw/statistician.html. See GFDB for EN's equivalent: https://gf-db.github.io/gfdb/gfdb.html), the 2000/500/2000/1000 recipe para drop rate is 3.1% (EN's rate is around 2.0%), which translates to an average cost of approximately 65000 manpower, 16200 ammo, 65000 rations, 32500 parts, and 65 cores. Note that the exact cost depends on your individual crafting luck.

It is highly recommended to wait until general rateups (annually in January, May, and September) to craft paras, when the para rates are substantially higher.

### 3000 Dev EXP's Worth of Fodder
This has almost nothing to do with luck. It takes about 200-300 low-cost fairies as fodder to reach 3000 dev exp, depending on exactly how you enhance the para. Same-talent fodder gives 15 dev exp, while different-talent fodder gives 10 dev exp.

**Fairy fodder is by far the most expensive and time-consuming part of 5\*ing a para. Planning out the acquisition of fodder is the key to reducing the time needed to 5\* a para.**

### Resources for Enhancement
42000 MP, 9000 ammo, 30000 MRE, 24000 parts.

### Resources for Calibration
If you calib feed, the estimated cost is about 1800 calibration tickets. If you only want to get a good talent, the estimated cost is about 1200 calibration tickets. Each calibration ticket spent also has an additional cost of 40 resources (TL: this seems to be a mistake, it should be 10/10/10/3.33 resources per calib ticket).

### Fairy EXP
Using only combat reports, you need 3334. In 12-4E, you need about 1250 runs assuming all dolls are 5x linked.

### Skill Data
Paras are strategy fairies, who consume 1200 basic, 2040 intermediate, and 1000 advanced data (a total of ~106 combat sim energy).

# Part 2: Enhancement Methods
Various methods of enhancing fairies are discussed [in this article](https://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=24080978), below is a summary of the methods relevant to 5\*ing paras.

### Calibration Feeding
Get 200+ fairy armory slots, and get about 200-220 fodder fairies. First feed the fodders with the same talent as the para to be raised. After enhancing, calibrate the para, and then feed all the fodders with the para's new talent. Repeat until you either land on one of the target talents above 2000 dev exp, or after reaching 5\*.
- estimated fodder consumption: 200-220
- pros: the most efficient raising method
- cons: need to get fairy slots

### Focus Feeding
(TL: not aware of a different name for this)
Whenever you craft a same-talent fodder, feed immediately. Every time your fairy slots get filled, calibrate your para once and feed all the fodders with the new talent. Repeat until you either land on one of the target talents, or after reaching 5\*.
- estimated fodder consumption: 270-290\*
- pros: don't need to get fairy slots
- cons: low fodder efficiency

* the fodder consumption here is calculated assuming that the number of available slots is very limited, i.e. each calibration, only one fodder is fed. The more fairy slots you have, the less fodder is needed. Once fairy slots hit 200+, this is equivalent to calibration feeding.

### Concurrent Feeding
*Only recommended after you have 1 or 2 5\* paras*

First get 8-10 paras with different talents. Upon crafting a fodder with a talent in the para pool, feed to the appropriate para until it hits 5\*. Fodders that do not have the same talent as any of the paras will be fed to one of the paras until it hits 5\*.
- estimated fodder consumption: 240 per para
- pros: don't need to get fairy slots
- cons: it takes a *very* long time to reach 5\*

# Acquiring Fodder
In the first section, we mentioned that acquiring fodder is the primary cost for 5\*ing paras, taking up roughly 85-90% of the total resource consumption. According to my own calculations, statistics, and general experience, during non-rateup, the 500x4 recipe fairy rate is about 20% (closer to 21% on GFDB). To calib feed, with roughly 210 fodders / para, this is about 1050 HECs. The resources consumed are: 525000 MP/ammo/MRE/parts, 1050 equipment contracts, and 2100 cores. Using the [recommended logistics for fairy rateup](https://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=24807338), you can guarantee **16 HECs per day** without interfering with exploration, daily quests, and daily corpse dragging. 

With this in mind, the time needed to acquire fodders is about **65 days**. That's right, 5\* para is as easy as that.

~~what? you're telling me I need 2100 cores? you're killing me~~

# Raising Procedure and Timing
## Step 1: Prepare a Parachute Fairy
Every year, there are 3 general rateups; these are the best times to para craft. It is recommended to spend all the equipment tickets built up from dailies: using Tier 2 HECs and the 2000/500/2000/1000 recipe during rateup, it typically takes 20-25 pulls to get a para. ~~last rateup I did 50 T2 HECs and para didn't come home, who do I ask for compensation? T_T~~

If there's still a lot of time before the next rateup, it's reasonable to do 6-7 para pulls a day to get a para. It should take about 35-40 pulls to get one, or a bit more than a week.

## Step 2: Prepare Fairy Fodder
The fodder can be prepared once the para is ready. Using 16 HECs per day as the baseline, the various feeding methods take different amounts of time to complete:
- Calibration feeding: as mentioned above, 65 days
- Focus feeding: using 280 fairies as a baseline, 88 days
- Concurrent feeding: assuming that you raise 9 paras simultaneously, under the assumption that all talents appear at the same rate, the duration needed for each para to reach 5\* will be roughly:

| para # | days |
|-|-|
| 1 | 161 |
| 2 | 126 |
| 3 | 106 |
| 4 | 82 |
| 5 | 68 |
| 6 | 57 |
| 7 | 48 |
| 8 | 42 |
| 9 | 35 |

The average duration is 77 days. Notice that concurrent feeding is slower than calibration feeding up until the fourth para, only catches up on average after the seventh para, and is less cost-effective. Unless you're raising them for the sake of raising them, don't plan on making them combat-ready, or **already have enough paras, this method is not recommended by any means.**

## Step 3: Prepare the Resources for Calibration
If you want your para to be combat-ready, calibration is mandatory. It is recommended that your first para have the Fervor talent and the second have the Critical 2 talent. Subsequent paras can have Fervor, Damage 2, or Critical 2. (Critical 2 is slightly better than the other talents)

If you plan on calib feeding, you will need roughly 1800 calibration tickets and enough resources, roughly 3 days' worth of logistics. The other two methods need about 1200 calibration tickets each, roughly 2 days' worth of logistics. 

The resources for enhancing is also about 3 days' worth of logistics.

> low MRE warning!

## Step 4: Other Resources
Other resources such as combat sim energy, fairy EXP, or calibration tickets can be acquired much faster than the other resources, so they aren't the bottleneck for the training speed. When you're raising stuff, **do not waste your calibration tickets**. You should otherwise be able to keep your calibration tickets in line with the rest of your progress.

It is recommended to look back to refer back to this article for the acquisition and planning of these resources.

## Step 5: Raising duration
From the above calculations, we can find the duration for each of the enhancement methods:
- calib feeding: about **78 days** per para
- focus feeding: about **98 days** per para
- concurrent feedint: about **90 days** per para (but the first few paras will take much longer)

# Postscript
I didn't plan to write so much for this article, but it still feels like I wrote a lot anyways.

I wanted to see if writing an article on Bilibili would be nice.

User experience is shit, formatting twisted itself into a snake, and apparently even nested formatting can't be done

You can't even put external hyperlinks, Bilibili seriously sucks

With how few fans I have, nobody would read my Bilibili post anyways, so I still posted on NGA in the end

The main reason was that I originally intended to shitpost over a thousand words, so that when somebody tells me that Origin Fairies are P2W, I can pull up this article and laugh in his face

I didn't intend to post this to NGA before Bilibili, if you want to support me then please go to the Bilibili post: [https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv9390942]

~~but the user experience seriously sucks, I don't plan on posting on Bilibili again~~
