# Overview
Rating: General Use - **S+**

How to use: RoF HG, presently the best RoF buffer in the game

**Must raise**, MOD 2/3 is not worth the cost, MOD 1 is recommended.

# Details
**Defensive Capabilities**: Stechkin's defensive stats put her in the top ranks of HGs in terms of tankiness (assuming all wearing T-exos). Columns in the table below are, from left to right, HP, base EVA, EVA from affection bonus and equipment, and effective HP.
![A table depicting the following HGs: Jill Stingray - 400/96/55/3017, C96 MOD - 425/71/66/2948, Sei Asagiri - 425/77/51/2782, Stechkin MOD - 425/69/56/2727, Grizzly MkV - 430/66/52/2629.](https://i0.hdslb.com/bfs/article/b19843ae4e34943a0ba02af84a81708fff7a6013.png@1270w_1290h.webp "Effective HP calculations assume 30% EVA buff (5* taunt), 45 EVA from equipment, best equipment, max affection, 30 enemy ACC. This is a basic comparison, not taking link protection or armor break into account.")

**Tiles**: Stechkin's tiles reach a score of **40**, placing her well within T0 (baseline score is 34). Providing both RoF and FP buffs, she's suitable for any situation.

**Assault Command**: two parts: typical 5\* Assault Command giving a 25% RoF buff. When carrying her Buttstock SPEQ, she also gives 4% FP. For an infinitely long battle, the average buff is 20%, higher than the typical 5\*'s 16.67%. The SPEQ is a limited drop from 9-4N, hurry up and grab it!

**Percussion**: during Assault Order (8s), increases her own FP by 25% and her own crit rate by 100% (with both SPEQs equipped, it's possible to cap crit rate). Prioritizes targeting enemies with the lowest HP, reduces enemy EVA by 50% for 8s.

On paper, this skill looks pretty scary. Can Stechkin be a DPS HG? Here's a simple conclusion:

> When deciding if a doll can be a DPS unit, just look at whether she has a **Focus**\* skill

(\* greatly buffs own DPS output, e.g. Damage Focus or other similar skills, the self-buff should buff DPS by at least 50%)

In fact, Stechkin's DPS is roughly 0.46 Hometes (ignoring skill 2), and Percussion only increases her DPS output by 29-37% (dependent on whether fairy aura has crit dmg), it can be said that there's no hope for her to be a DPS unit. Debuffing enemy EVA requires their HP to be less than 30%. In actual combat, you have to hit the enemy to reduce their evasion, recall the embarrasment of X95's Flower Lock.

In the Lee-Wa team (Lee-Enfield + WA2000 RFHG), regardless of whether Stechkin was MOD 3, her DPS output was between 2.4-0.5% of the team's total DPS (from 0-120 armor, no EVA). Stechkin's buffing capabilities are T0, Percussion is just the icing on the cake. Considering the high cost of modding, it is recommended to bring her to MOD 1.

# Support Capabilities
\* The tests below ignore Percussion's EVA debuff (but the FP and crit rate self-buffs are still in effect). To minimize the gap between the HGs' DPS, the enemy has 30 EVA and 120 armor. Stechkin is using both SPEQs.

**Comparing to Calico**: Under these test conditions, the Stechkin team performed **+5%** better than the Calico team. Battle conditions 5\* Parachute with Damage 2 talent, fairy skill off, battle length 20s.
![The formation is WA2000 on 7, Stechkin/Grizzly on 4, Lee-Enfield on 1, Grizzly/Calico on 5, and P22 on 2.](https://i0.hdslb.com/bfs/article/dfa6863af4ebc371734af06d87aaf164f99e5c91.png@1320w_904h.webp "Stechkin's support capabilities are roughly 5% higher than Calico's.")

**Comparing to Five-seveN**: Under these test conditions, even with Px4 Storm on board, the Stechkin team performed on par with the Five-seveN team, with a DPS difference between **+1 - -3%** (dependent on fairy's crit dmg aura). Battle conditions 5\* Artillery/Parachute with Damage 2 talent, fairy skill off, battle length 20s.
![The formation is WA2000 on 7, Stechkin/Five-seveN on 4, Lee-Enfield on 1, Px4 Storm on 8, and P22 on 2.](https://i0.hdslb.com/bfs/article/b7ce8635acc046d2dd124f899c58a68f50630441.png@1320w_1184h.webp "Even with Px4 Storm, Stechkin's DPS support can be tied with Five-seveN.")

Once you consider Percussion's EVA debuff and the increase to Stechkin's own DPS (depending on enemy formation, this can be an additional 1-5% buff), Stechkin can be considered to be the game's strongest ROF buffer HG.

# Conclusion
The best at RoF buffing

MOD DPS self-buff is just the icing on the cake

MOD 1 is highly recommended from a cost effectiveness perspective, must raise
